You are the development agent for **StreakMind-v2**. The following updates and changes need to be introduced and implemented in the app. Carefully understand the scope and generate code + UI/UX updates accordingly.  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Updates & Fixes  

### 1. Memory for the Bot  
- Introduce a **memory system** for the chat assistant.  
- Memory should allow the bot to **retain necessary context across sessions**.  
- Store minimal but key information for **personalized responses** (e.g., user name, preferences, recurring activities).  
- Use a lightweight **memory.json** (or similar file) in the directory to persist this info during the testing phase.  

### 2. Chat System Improvements  
- **Chat persistence:** Save and load chat history from a `chats.json` file. Refreshing the page should not clear chat.  
- **Efficient chat management:**  
  - Allow users to **select and delete specific chats**.  
  - Add a **bulk delete** option.  
- Ensure the **chat input box always has the cursor active** (before and after sending).  
- Make the chat interface smooth with **animated transitions** for messages (e.g., fade-in or slide-up).  

### 3. Dashboard Enhancements (UI/UX)  
- **Fix broken dashboard (blank screen issue).**  
- Ensure **activity tiles**:  
  - Can be **deleted** properly.  
  - **Edit panel** saves changes (renaming & visualization type).  
  - Visualization updates (heatmap, bar, progress, pie) are **saved and reflected** in the dashboard.  
- Add subtle **animations & transitions** for a modern, dynamic feel (hover effects, smooth updates).  
- Keep dashboard **interactive and fluid**, no static blank screen.  

### 4. Settings Persistence  
- Current settings reset on refresh.  
- Introduce a `settings.json` file to **persist user preferences**.  
- Settings should be **synced across sessions** (dark mode, chat toggle, etc.).  

### 5. Remove Father Mode  
- **Completely remove "Father Mode"** from app, codebase, and settings.  
- Ensure no UI remnants or logic references remain.

## ðŸŽ¨ UX/UI Requirements  
- Replace static tile UI with **animated, dynamic components**.  
- Smooth **page transitions and element animations** (e.g., when adding/editing/deleting activities, when settings update).  
- Keep dashboard and chat **engaging but minimal**.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Development Notes  
- Use lightweight **JSON-based persistence** (`chats.json`, `settings.json`, `memory.json`) for now since this is a testing phase.  
- Ensure CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for:  
  - Chats  
  - Settings  
  - Activities  
- Optimize for **efficiency, clean UX, and reliability**.

## ðŸ›ˆ Update Info Button ("i")  
Update the **info/help section** to explain the new features:  
- Bot now has **memory** for personalized interactions.  
- Chats are **persistent** and can be **selected/deleted individually or in bulk**.  
- Dashboard activities can be **renamed, deleted, and switched between visualizations**.  
- Settings are now **saved across sessions**.  
- App is **animation-enhanced** for smoother experience.  
- "Father Mode" has been removed permanently.

âš¡ Make sure all these changes are integrated, tested, and reflected in the app with clean UI/UX and working persistence.
