I want you to upgrade and redesign my habit-tracking + chat app with the following updates and requirements.

🔹 Core Vision

This app is a chat-based streak tracker and companion, powered by Google Gemini API for conversations.
It should feel like a therapist, friend, trainer, and father (tough love) all in one — the tone adapts depending on context.

Users interact only via chat:

Free conversations are powered by Gemini.

When a user mentions an activity log (e.g., “I went to gym today”), the system automatically records it.

The app should support dynamic activity creation through chat (e.g., “I want to track book reading” → adds a new tracker in dashboard).

🔹 Features & Functionality

Gemini API Chat Brain

Chat should feel natural, human-like, and adaptive.

Gemini is the main conversational layer.

Streak tracking & activity logging run in the background.

Activity Logging

Each activity can be logged once per day for streak increment.

Multiple logs per day allowed (different activities).

Streaks only increment once per day per activity.

Dynamic Activity Creation

User can add new activities directly from chat.

Newly created activity should immediately appear on dashboard & scoring system.

Gamified Scores (Optional)

Users can toggle ON/OFF score visibility in settings.

When OFF → score dashboard is hidden/inaccessible.

When ON → users see detailed scores.

Scoring system includes streak counts, activity points, and badges.

Tile-Based Dashboard UI

Replace the old score dashboard with modern tile-based design.

Each activity has its own tile showing:

Current streak

Progress (bar/ring/heatmap depending on activity type)

Points earned

Tiles should be responsive and minimalistic.

Info (“i”) Button Update

Info modal should now explain:

How to log activities by just chatting.

How to create a new activity (“I want to track XYZ”).

How to toggle scores ON/OFF.

That the AI can act as therapist/friend/trainer/father.

🔹 UI/UX Requirements

Minimal monochrome aesthetic with accent colors.

Chat bubbles: User → right side, AI → left side.

Smooth transitions between chat and dashboard updates.

Tile-based layout for score dashboard.

Dark theme default, light theme option available.

🔹 Summary of Updates from Previous Version

Gemini chat → not restricted to predefined logs.

Dynamic activity creation via chat.

Optional gamification (toggle ON/OFF).

Tile-based redesign for score dashboard.

Info modal updated with new usage instructions.

Personality layer (therapist, friend, trainer, father).
