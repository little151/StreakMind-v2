Project Update Instructions for StreakMind-v2

We are updating our project to fix bugs and add important UX and functional improvements. Please implement the following changes:

üõ†Ô∏è Core Fixes

Chat Reset + Delete Option

Ensure chat history is cleared whenever the page is refreshed.

Add the ability for users to manually delete chats from the UI (individual messages + clear all option).

Cursor behavior: whenever the chat window loads or a message is sent, the typing cursor should stay focused in the chat input field automatically.

Activity Management (CRUD)

The edit and delete options for activities in the dashboard currently don‚Äôt work. Fix them so users can reliably:

Edit an activity name, points, or details.

Delete an activity permanently from the dashboard and data.json.

Visualization Choice per Activity

When users add or edit an activity, let them choose how they want it tracked:

Heatmap

Bar chart

Progress bar

Pie chart

Save these visualization preferences in data.json so refreshing does not reset them.

Ensure the dashboard dynamically renders these chosen visualizations.

üé® UI / UX & Animations

Drop Tile UI Approach

Remove the tile-based score UI. Replace it with a more dynamic, fluid, animation-driven layout.

Animation & Transitions

Add smooth animations across the app:

Chat messages slide/fade in.

Dashboard visualizations load with transitions.

Activity cards expand/collapse with animations.

Navigation elements animate smoothly.

General Styling

Keep the app modern and clean with a dynamic feel.

Prioritize usability while making the interface engaging.

üö´ Personality Modes Update

Remove Father Mode completely from the app.

Keep only the therapist, friend, and trainer modes.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Info (‚Äúi‚Äù) Modal Update

Update the ‚Äúi‚Äù info/help section to include:

Chat auto-clears on refresh; option to manually delete messages.

Activities now support full CRUD (edit/delete).

Users can assign a visualization type (heatmap, bar, progress bar, pie) when adding/editing activities.

Visualization choices persist across refreshes.

Cursor auto-focuses in chat input.

Tile UI removed ‚Üí replaced with animated, dynamic dashboard.

Personality modes updated: therapist, friend, trainer only.
