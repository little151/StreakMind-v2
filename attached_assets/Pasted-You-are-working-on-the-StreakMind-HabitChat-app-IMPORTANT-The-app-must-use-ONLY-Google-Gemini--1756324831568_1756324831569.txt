You are working on the StreakMind (HabitChat) app. 
IMPORTANT: The app must use ONLY Google Gemini API. 
⚠️ WARNING: I will provide you with a text file containing the original build chat log where there may be mentions of OpenAI integration. IGNORE ALL OpenAI mentions in that file. DO NOT re-add OpenAI under any circumstance. We must rely exclusively on Google Gemini API.

Your tasks:

1. Use the provided .txt file (original chat log) only as a reference to understand:
   - How the project was initially compiled successfully.
   - How the interactive preview was launched correctly.
   - How missing dependencies and import path issues were handled.

2. Core Requirements:
   - Remove all traces of OpenAI (packages, env vars, routes, code, docs).
   - Ensure the server and chat routes are fully working with Gemini only.
   - The app should only require `GEMINI_API_KEY` from Replit Secrets.

3. Frontend Fix:
   - The current issue is that the web app cannot compile or load the preview.
   - Carefully compare the current state with the successful build process in the original chat log.
   - Resolve any Vite/TypeScript path alias or import resolution issues so that `npm run dev` works without errors.
   - Verify that the interactive preview works just like it did in the first successful build.

4. Backend Fix:
   - Confirm that the server routes call ONLY Gemini API for chat.
   - Simplify by removing any dual-AI fallback logic left over from the previous attempt.
   - Ensure chat responses are generated only via Gemini.

5. Deliverable:
   - A fully working StreakMind app running in Replit with interactive preview.
   - Chat works only with Gemini API.
   - `npm run dev` (development mode) must work cleanly.
   - Document the final run commands for dev and production.

DO NOT integrate OpenAI even if the original chat log shows instructions for it.
Your mission is to use the log only as a guide for fixing the build + preview issues, but the final app must be Gemini-only.
