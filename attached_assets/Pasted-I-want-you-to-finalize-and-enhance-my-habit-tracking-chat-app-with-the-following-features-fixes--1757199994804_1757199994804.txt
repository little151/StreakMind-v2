I want you to finalize and enhance my habit-tracking + chat app with the following features, fixes, and upgrades. This is the final shot, so please integrate everything cleanly.

üîπ Core Vision

This app is a chat-first streak tracker + personal AI companion, powered by the Google Gemini API.
It should feel like a therapist, friend, trainer, or father (tough love) depending on the context ‚Äî but users must also have the option to toggle personalities.

The app must allow both chat-based interactions and manual dashboard management.

üîπ Features & Functionality
1. Conversational Brain (Gemini API)

All chat powered by Google Gemini API.

If the user asks something unrelated to tracking (e.g., generic question), Gemini should respond like a normal AI assistant, unfiltered.

If the user mentions logs or streaks, app auto-detects and records progress in the background.

2. Activity Management

Dynamic creation via chat (e.g., ‚ÄúI want to track reading books‚Äù ‚Üí new activity created).

Manual dashboard option: users can also add new activities via a plus (+) button on the dashboard.

CRUD operations (chat or manual):

Create ‚Üí new activity

Read ‚Üí view activity details

Update ‚Üí rename activity, change point values

Delete ‚Üí remove activity

3. Personality System

Default: AI behaves as therapist/friend/trainer/father (adaptive).

Toggle ON/OFF specific personalities in settings.

Example: If user disables "father," app won‚Äôt use that personality.

4. Scoring System

Each activity gets default points from the app (e.g., 10 per log).

User option to override ‚Üí set custom points per activity.

Scores & streaks update automatically when activities are logged.

Scoreboard visibility toggle:

ON ‚Üí shows tile-based dashboard

OFF ‚Üí completely hidden/inaccessible

5. Dashboard & UI

Tile-based redesign:

Each activity displayed as a tile showing streak, points, and progress.

Tiles should support quick edit (update points, rename, delete).

Manual Add/Delete buttons for activities (in addition to chat).

Dark theme default, light theme optional.

6. Info (‚Äúi‚Äù) Button Update

The info modal should now explain:

How to log activities in chat.

How to manually add/delete activities.

How CRUD works through chat commands.

How to toggle personalities.

How to set custom points.

How to toggle the score dashboard ON/OFF.

That the AI also works as a general-purpose chatbot for anything outside tracking.

üîπ Summary of New Updates

Manual activity add/delete alongside chat-based creation.

Full CRUD support via chat & dashboard.

Toggle specific personalities (e.g., remove ‚Äúfather‚Äù role).

Custom user-defined point values per activity.

Scoreboard tile redesign (with quick-edit options).

Gemini API fallback for generic questions (acts like normal AI).
